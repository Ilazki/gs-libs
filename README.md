### Various functions for MiniScript / Grey Hack

A collection of MiniScript functions for use in the game Grey Hack.

Files with the .ms extension are tested and confirmed to work with the [MiniScript command-line interpreter](https://miniscript.org/cmdline/).  Files with .src or .gsc extensions rely on Grey Hack-specific features and are only intended to be used in the game.

.gsc files are intended for use with [gsc](https://github.com/Ilazki/gsc) and its `//#open` pragma.  They can still be used without it via copy-and-paste if desired.
